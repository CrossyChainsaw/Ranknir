- Add console players to your elo lists (with the help of [Dadabase](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/Dadabase))

## Add this bot to your server
- As if right now there are too many servers Ranknir is active in. Accepting more clans would slow down the process for everyone so I stopped accepting clans for now.

# Ranknir
A discord bot written for a Brawlhalla clan named Skyward.

## How to use
type `rstart` in any channel. Ranknir bot should send a list of all your clan members their 2v2 elo. Also does it show the clan xp and the clan image. Ranknir bot also puts the clan member before the `+`, this way you can see who's in the clan and who isn't. Ranknir updates the list every few hours. This can't be sped up due to API rate limits.

## Bot Stopped
If the bot randomly stops updating, it got a ban from discord. This happens because my bot is hosted on a server together with multiple bots on the same IP. if any of the bots there get an IP ban, my bot gets taken down as well. This also stops the loop, so you will have to use the command `rstart` again to restart it.

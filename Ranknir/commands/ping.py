I am currently coordinating efforts with the local volcano authorities and enacting emergency protocols to ensure the safe retrieval of my offspring. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and assure you that I am committed to resolving this situation as swiftly as possible. I will keep you updated on any developments and my estimated return to work.")
